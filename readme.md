- Here, I conducted UAT for websites and mobile applications for three months, from November 21st to April 22nd, using manual testing. I created test cases and test plans with various scenarios. The test plan used two statuses to determine whether a feature passed or failed, as well as three indicators for retesting, depending on the feature: major, minor, and none.
